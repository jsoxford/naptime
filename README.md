# naptime!

Yo! Welcome to naptime, the npm dependency viewer.

We made this for the [Node Knockout 2012 competition](http://nodeknockout.com/).

It inspects your package.json, checks the current state of your dependencies against the npm registry, and gives you feedback as to how up to date your dependencies are.

You can currently see it in action at [woah.nko3.jitsu.com](http://woah.nko3.jitsu.com)

Enjoy!
